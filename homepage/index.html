     <h3> Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3>
     <p> Progressive enhancement is what allows for a website to be structured based on its content and to be styled directly by its trained user. I feel that this is important in a modern web development world due to its ability to be a true user centered way of data implementation. It allows users to dictate what they use and style their sites off of based on their comfort with the multiple layers of software. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/ I found this insightful due to it breaking down each layer in depth. </p>
     <h3>Dragon Project Revison and Reflection Project</h3>
     <p>I interviewed my roomate to get their thoughts on my site. He said it looked sleek and had modern feel to it. He did point out that the contacts page was a little bare and severed little purpose to the site. Taking his criticism I added a Jquery slideshow of the pictures in the site after the contact information. This project taught me the value of previous work, and how it can be used as a template for future endeavors. This semester I have come to enjoy entering in the code on AWS and seeing an actual return on a site screen. I feel that through my trial and error I have grown to undersatnd and enjoy the aspects of web design that we have covered in this class. I feel that if I had to do something differently, I would attempt to do better on the Gravit logo assignment. Mainly due to the level of editting that is required. Thank you for a great semester, I truly enjoyed your class and you as a teacher. </p>
